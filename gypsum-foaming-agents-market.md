<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gypsum Foaming Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stable Foaming Agents</li><li>Unstable Foaming Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gypsum foaming agents market is categorized into stable and unstable foaming agents. Stable foaming agents produce bubbles that maintain their structure, resulting in long-lasting foam suitable for applications requiring durability and strength, such as in construction materials. Unstable foaming agents, on the other hand, generate bubbles that collapse quickly, leading to lightweight, short-lived foam ideal for insulation or temporary structures. Both types serve distinct purposes in gypsum formulations, impacting performance and application suitability.</p></p>

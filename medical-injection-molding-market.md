<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Injection Molding Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Runner</li><li>Hot Runner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical injection molding market is categorized into two main types: cold runner and hot runner systems. Cold runner systems utilize a channel that remains solid and is discarded after the molding process, making them cost-effective for simpler applications. In contrast, hot runner systems keep the material molten within the runner channel, reducing waste and cycle times, thus enhancing efficiency and precision. Both types serve the medical sector, catering to diverse product needs such as syringes, implants, and diagnostic devices.</p></p>

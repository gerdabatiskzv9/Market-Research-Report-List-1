<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cold Recycler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Asphalt Emulsion Recycler</li><li>Foamed Asphalt Recycler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cold recycler market is segmented into two primary types: asphalt emulsion recyclers and foamed asphalt recyclers. Asphalt emulsion recyclers rejuvenate aged asphalt pavement by mixing it with emulsified asphalt, enhancing its properties for reuse. Foamed asphalt recyclers, on the other hand, introduce water to hot asphalt binder, creating a foamed version that reduces viscosity and improves workability. Both methods aim to promote sustainability in road construction and maintenance by extending the life of existing materials while reducing environmental impact.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Motorless Water Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive-Displacement</li><li>Centrifugal Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The motorless water pumps market is categorized into two main types: positive-displacement and centrifugal pumps. Positive-displacement pumps function by trapping a fixed amount of water and forcing it out, making them ideal for applications requiring precise flow rates and higher pressures. Conversely, centrifugal pumps utilize rotational energy to move water, making them suitable for large volumes and low-pressure applications. Both types are efficient alternatives to motor-driven pumps, offering advantages such as reduced energy consumption and maintenance costs.</p></p>

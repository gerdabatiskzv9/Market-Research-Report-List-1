<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smoke Exhaust Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Side Suction</li><li>Top Suction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The smoke exhaust ventilators market features two primary types: side suction and top suction systems. Side suction ventilators are designed to draw smoke horizontally from the sides of a building, making them suitable for applications where ceiling height is limited. In contrast, top suction ventilators operate by extracting smoke directly from the ceiling area, effectively removing hot gases and smoke to enhance occupant safety during fires. Both types are critical for ensuring effective smoke control and improved air quality in emergency situations.</p></p>
